Independently learning neural networks by utilizing 
Andrew W. Trask's Grokking Deep Learning book.

Here you will see me update this repository with projects/problems from this book 
done by myself in an effort to learn more about neural networks.

Despite this bookk not being the most technically challenging books 
I think its perfect for someone like me who wants to learn the basics of what it 
means to learn Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and more from that respective field
of computer science.
